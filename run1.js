Definitions. 10 1152. Disclosure to news media workers. 11 1153. Disclosure to consumers. 12 1154. Oversight of artificial intelligence systems. 13 1155. Workplace protections. 14 § 1150. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that: 15 1. New York is the center of the American news industry and journal- 16 ists are a key part of the state's workforce. 17 2. Artificial intelligence can quickly generate articles, summaries, 18 news scripts, audio/visual and other media content that may seem profes- 19 sionally done to a lay observer. However, there is ample evidence that 20 content created by generative artificial intelligence: (a) contains 21 false or misleading content; and (b) plagiarizes by deriving its content 22 from original source material without permission or proper citation. 23 These failures are a disservice to the public who relies on the news for 24 accurate information about the world.
